# How to measure a distance between earth and the sun
  * Attempt of the Royal Society leading to Captain Cook expedition 1769-1779 in Tahiti
    * C. Herdendorf, Captain James Cook and the transits of mercury and venus. Journal of Pacific History 1986
    * How could transit of Venus helps solve a distance between earth and the sun
      * "To use the transits as an accurate measure of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, observations had to be made from widely-spaced locations."

      > "In these methods you will compare tracks of Mercury across the disc of the Sun as seen from two different observing sites. Using the two sets of tracks you can determine the angular shift, or parallax, (in seconds of arc, between the two tracks at one particular time). The distance between the Earth and the Sun can be determined with, the value of the angular shift and the distance between the two observing sites.

      > Whilst the mathematics simply involves trigonometry, the conceptualization of what is happening and what needs to be taken into account is not trivial, therefore to help if needed, a spreadsheet has also been provided that will compute the result for you."
