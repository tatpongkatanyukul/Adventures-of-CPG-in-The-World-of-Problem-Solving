    * How could transit of Venus helps solve a distance between earth and the sun
      * "To use the transits as an accurate measure of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, observations had to be made from widely-spaced locations."
      * "Edmond Halley was the first to develop a method for making the complex calculations. He published his most important paper on the transit of Venus in 1716, knowing he would not live long enough to witness the next transit in 1761."
      * "The favoured instruments of the major British expeditions of the 18th century were reflecting telescopes, which use a mirror rather than a lens as the primary optical component. The preferred supplier was James Short, who specialised exclusively in the manufacture of reflectors."
      * "The telescopes were used together with an expeditions clocks to see and time the key moments of a transit. By adding a micrometer, a telescope could also be converted into a measuring instrument, so that small angles such as the diameter of Venus could be accurately determined."
      * "Those observers sent on expeditions were travelling to sites selected primarily for their geographical position." 
      * "But factors such as climate and the current relations with indigenous peoples and other European nations were also factors in the process of selection. War between Britain and France disrupted the plans of some observers in 1761." 
      * "Beyond their astronomical mission, the larger expeditions provided opportunities for more extensive exploration. The botanist Joseph Banks launched his career as a natural historian on Captain Cook’s voyage, returning as a celebrity with new species and dramatic tales of discovery."
      * "... Rather than converging towards a single value for the distance from the Earth to the Sun, different astronomers arrived at slightly different results. This spread of values left the sense that “the most noble problem in nature” was yet to be conclusively settled.

      > "In these methods you will compare tracks of Mercury across the disc of the Sun as seen from two different observing sites. Using the two sets of tracks you can determine the angular shift, or parallax, (in seconds of arc, between the two tracks at one particular time). The distance between the Earth and the Sun can be determined with, the value of the angular shift and the distance between the two observing sites.

      > Whilst the mathematics simply involves trigonometry, the conceptualization of what is happening and what needs to be taken into account is not trivial, therefore to help if needed, a spreadsheet has also been provided that will compute the result for you."

      > "The Sun must never be viewed directly, and you must never look through the eyepiece of a telescope to view the Sun.
      > The safest way to view the transit of Mercury is to project the Sun onto a shaded white surface using a telescope or a pair of binoculars.
