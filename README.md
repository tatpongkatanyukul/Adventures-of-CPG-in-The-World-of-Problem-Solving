# AdventuresCPGinTheWorld

I dream of composing my curiosity-driven programming problems into a book. It may happen or it may not. But, I love to learn.

# Problems to add
  * How time, mutation, and natural selection give evolution (Evolution: Sean B. Carrol's talk)
  * How to measure distance between earth and the moon (Astronomy)
    * related: [how to measure distance between earth and the sun](https://github.com/tatpongkatanyukul/AdventuresCPGinTheWorld/blob/main/measure_sun_distance.md)
  * What mechanism could make an useful operator in quantum computing (Quantum Computing)
  * ??? (Quantum physics)
  * ??? (Navier-Stokes, Fluid dynamics)
  * ??? (Thermodynamics)
  * ??? (Electromagnetics)
